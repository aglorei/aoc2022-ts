## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Node.js installed. There's a few ways to do this.

If you're using a package manager (e.g., Homebrew, apt, yum, etc.), see instructions to do so from the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

If you're interested in using containers (with say, a Docker runtime), instantiate a container from the [Docker Hub node image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node), and mount your project root as a volume. For example, using the current [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) of `18.12.1` (if you don't understand these options, look them up with `docker run --help`):

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) --workdir $(pwd) node:18.12.1 /bin/bash
```

Once you have Node.js installed, ensure that [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is installed. We use pnpm as an alternative Node.js package manager to npm and yarn. It's (unsurprisingly) managed by npm, installed globally (may require updating your npm version):

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Project Dependencies

Once pnpm is installed, have pnpm read your [package.json](package.json) manifest and install the project dependencies. In this case, I had to "hoist" dependencies into a flat `node_modules` structure, lest my `aocrunner` is not able to access the `esbuild` dependency. If you can figure out a way to get around this...please do and let me know (or update this document).

```
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Running in dev mode

```
pnpm start <day>
```

Example:

```
pnpm start 1
```
